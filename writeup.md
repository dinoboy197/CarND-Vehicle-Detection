**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).
I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

My general optimization strategy for this project was to increase the accuracy of the classifier by tuning one feature extraction parameter at a time among the feature, color space, and various hyperparameters for the feature set type selected. While not a complete grid search of all available parameters for tuning in the feature space, my results show reasonably good performance.

My first investigation was into the effect of HOG, color histogram, and spatial binned features. Using reasonable defaults provided by the sample code provided, HOG features alone led to the most robust classifier in terms of accuracy without much tuning; addition of either color histogram or spatial features greatly increased the number of false positive vehicle detections. For this project, I chose to focus on HOG features alone and optimize them. This doesn't discount the possible usefulness of histogram or spatial features, I've simply chosen to focus my research in this project on HOG features.

I briefly experimented with different color spaces for HOG feature extraction. I quickly discarded RGB features, whose performance both in training and on the videos was subpar to the other spaces. Eventually, the YCrCb color space showed as particularly well performing on both the training images and in video.

Next, I optimized various hyperparameters of the HOG transformation: number of HOG channels, number of HOG orientations, and pixels per cell (cells per block remained at 2 for all tests). In studying the classification results from both test images, test video and the project video, I found that the following parameters yielded the best classification accuracy:

* HOG channels: all
* Number of HOG orientations: 9
* Pixels per cell: 8

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)

My pipeline successfully generates [a video stream which shows bounding boxes around the vehicles](project_video_processed.mp4). While the bounding boxes are somewhat wobbly, the vehicles in the driving direction are identifed with relatively high recall and precision.

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
